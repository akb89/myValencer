# myValencer: A small client for the Valencer

This project is a small client for the [Valencer](https://github.com/akb89/valencer) project. 

## How to Install

It can be run without external dependencies, just change the URL in js/config.js to point to your own valencer service and open _valencer.htm_.

## Implemented Features

Right now, the client is only able to request annotationSets (by IDs or by patterns), frames (by IDs or by patterns) and lexical units (by IDs or by patterns).
